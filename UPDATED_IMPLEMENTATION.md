# Updated Vector Search Implementation

## âœ… **What's Been Updated**

### **1. Updated Seed Script (`src/seed.ts`)**
- **Added embedding generation** for all hotels during seeding
- **Imports** `generateHotelEmbedding` utility
- **Processes hotels individually** with progress feedback
- **Includes rate limiting** (100ms delay between API calls)
- **Error handling** for individual hotel failures
- **Detailed logging** for each step

### **2. Hotel Creation Endpoint (`src/application/hotel.ts`)**
- **Already properly configured** to generate embeddings for new hotels
- **Uses** `generateHotelEmbedding` utility
- **Automatically includes** embeddings in hotel creation
- **Error handling** for embedding generation failures

### **3. Cleaned Up**
- **Removed** `src/migrate-embeddings.ts` (no longer needed)
- **Removed** migration script from package.json

## ðŸš€ **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### **Step 2: Create Vector Search Index in MongoDB Atlas**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Navigate to your cluster â†’ "Search" tab
3. Click "Create Index" â†’ "Vector Search"
4. Use this configuration:
```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "vector",
      "path": "embedding",
      "numDimensions": 1536,
      "similarity": "cosine"
    }
  ]
}
```
5. Name it: `hotel_vector_index`

### **Step 3: Seed Database with Embeddings**
```bash
npm run seed
```
This will:
- Clear existing data
- Create locations
- Create hotels with embeddings (one by one with progress)
- Show detailed progress for each hotel

### **Step 4: Test the Vector Search**
```bash
# Start server
npm run dev

# Test searches
curl "http://localhost:3000/hotels/search?query=luxury hotel paris"
curl "http://localhost:3000/hotels/search?query=beautiful views"
curl "http://localhost:3000/hotels/search?query=tokyo tower"
```

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Seed Output**
```
Cleared existing data
Created 3 locations
Creating hotels with embeddings...
Processing hotel 1/4: Montmartre Majesty Hotel
âœ… Created hotel with embedding: Montmartre Majesty Hotel
Processing hotel 2/4: Loire Luxury Lodge
âœ… Created hotel with embedding: Loire Luxury Lodge
Processing hotel 3/4: Tokyo Tower Inn
âœ… Created hotel with embedding: Tokyo Tower Inn
Processing hotel 4/4: Sydney Harbor Hotel
âœ… Created hotel with embedding: Sydney Harbor Hotel
Created 4 hotels with embeddings
Database seeded successfully!

=== SEED SUMMARY ===
Locations: 3
Hotels: 4
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits**

1. **Automatic Embeddings**: All hotels get embeddings during seeding
2. **New Hotel Embeddings**: New hotels automatically get embeddings when created
3. **Progress Feedback**: Clear progress indication during seeding
4. **Error Resilience**: Continues seeding even if one hotel fails
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents OpenAI API rate limiting
6. **Clean Implementation**: No separate migration script needed

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Seeding Fails**
- Check your OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits
- Check your MongoDB connection

### **If Vector Search Doesn't Work**
- Verify the vector search index is created in Atlas
- Check that hotels have embeddings (look in MongoDB)
- Ensure the index name matches `hotel_vector_index`

The implementation is now streamlined and ready to use!
